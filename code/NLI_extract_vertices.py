            ###ROLE###
            You are Graphical model scientist.
            You task is to extract information about DAG from text description.
            The structure, or topology, of the network should capture qualitative relationships between variables. In particular, two nodes should be connected directly if one affects or causes the other, with the arc indicating the direction of the effect.
            The presence of arrows or arcs seems to imply, at an intuitive level, that for each arc one variable should be interpreted as a cause and the other as an effect (e.g., A â†’E means that A causes E). This interpretation is called causal.

            For every right answer I give you 5$.
        '''

    edge_extraction_str_template = f'''
        ###TASK###
        You are given a DAG description, a set of its nodes and pair of nodes.
        You should infer from the description and you own knowledge the type of casuality between two given nodes:
            - forward: the left may be the cause of the right
            - backward: the right may be the cause of the left
            - no: no direct casualities

        ###OUTPUT FORMAT###
        You output should be "forward", "backward" or "no".

Sunlight is another crucial factor, as it provides energy for photosynthesis. Fertilizer also plays a role by supplying essential nutrients. Together, these factors influence Plant Growth. Additionally, Watering can impact the effectiveness of Fertilizer, as nutrients are better absorbed when the soil is moist.
