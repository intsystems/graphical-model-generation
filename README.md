## Abstract
This is a simplified template for software/libraries at Intelligent Systems.

The template is inherited from [Project template](https://github.com/intsystems/ProjectTemplate)

## Repository creation
After repository creation (recommended way is not to fork, but use is as a template), please do the steps from [this manual](https://github.com/intsystems/.github/blob/main/profile/repository_structure_rtfm.md).

## Master branch
By desing, master branch is protected from committing.  You should make pull requests to make changes into it.

## Documentation and test coverage
Documentation and test coverage badges can be updated automatically using [github actions](.github/workflows).

Initially both of these workflows are disabled (but can be run via "Actions" page).

To enable them automatically on push to master branch, change corresponding "yaml" files.
